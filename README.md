# Employe Login System
## Introduction:
This program takes the name of a user, and registers the time they got in on that day. <br />
This can also lookup all users that have logged in on that day. <br />
## <br />
All data stored within the CSV will be encrypted using the key which can be changed at the top of the program. <br />
## How to run it:
To run this program, you must also download my other repo: [Cipher Program](https://github.com/User25514/Cipher) <br />
This folder must be next to the Employee Login folder. <br />
